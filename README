ABOUT:
My project is all about mental health education that's simplified for kids. My project aims to inform kids about the concept of mental health, as well as provide mechanisms in which kids can learn to cope with feelings of stress and sadness. This project is important as, firstly, mental health is stigmatized. If we can implement mental health education early, the next generation will grow more tolerant of mental handicaps and become more sensitive to others and to themselves. Further, everyone can make use of coping mechanisms, yet there is an untapped audience that is young kids, who could use mental health services and need readily available resources. This website is created for younger kids, around the ages of 6-12. This project responds to this social justice issue by providing questionnaires that are IRB, clinical research approved, and then further information that accompanies the survey. This site mirrors a clinical study I currently participate in, though provides coping procedures where the clinical study lacks.
