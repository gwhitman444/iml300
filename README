ABOUT:
    My project is all about mental health education, but simplified for kids. This project aims to inform kids about the concept of mental hralth, as well as provide mechanisms in which kids can learn to cope with stress and sadness. This project is important as, a, mental health is stigmatized. If we can implement mental health education early, the next generation will grow more tolerant of mental handicaps and sensative to others and themselves. Further, everyone can use coping mechanisms, yet there is an untapped perspective that is young kids who could use mental health services and need them redily available. This website is created for younger kids, around the ages of 6-12. This project responds to this social justice issue by providing questionaires that are IRB, clinical research approved, and then further information that accompanies the survey. This site mirrors a clinical study I currently participate in, though provides coping procedures where the clinical study lacks.
