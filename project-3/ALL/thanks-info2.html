  <p>Feelings are like an emotional volcano...</p>  
     <p>Everyone has different emotions and feelings during their day, but if we don’t express those feelings, they remain in your volcano until it erupts!</p>
     <p>We'd like to avoid this!</p>
     <p>So, when you are having feelings, good or bad, you can talk to an adult or a friend, play outside, write it down, and take deep breaths!</p>

    <p>What can I do when I'm uncomfortable?</p> 
  <p>Sometimes, uncomfortable situations happen where we may feel extra nervous or uncomfortable, and sometimes, when we try something new, or something we aren't used to, we can feel anxious! So what can we do if this happens?</p>
  <p>Well, good news is that uncomfortable situations are temporary! We should be willing to try new things, because that is how we grow. </p>
  <p>If you feel anxious, begin with deep breaths! Try 5 seconds breathing in, 5 seconds holding your breath and 5 seconds breathing out.</p>

     <p>What can I do when I feel sad?</p> 
    <p>Feeling sad sometimes is perfectly normal! Everyone feels sad sometimes, even people like your teachers or tv stars. </p> 
    <p>What is important, however, is to speak with an adult if you feel sad more often than you feel happy, excited, or energetic. </p> 
    <p>Everyone feels sad now and then. When you tell someone how you feel and why, it helps you know that you’re not alone in your sadness. It also lets other people know what you need. Saying how you feel helps you get ready to do something that puts you in a happier mood.</p>
